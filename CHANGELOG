TODO:

- General:
    - Move as much styles as possible into CSS file and use classes instead.
        - Rework status icon via CSS val() and FontAwesome.
- Firefox:
    - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1413872

- Ideas:
    - With current configuration callbacks, optional permissions for Ratings/News could possibly be implemented.

Known issues:

- Possible new Netflix video player UI.
- Manifest v3.
- Video features work on all browsers except Edge, in fact Edge will get completely destroyed if video features are used/enabled
  and by completely destroyed I mean whole Edge turns black and starts flashing based on mouse location. This happens only when
  hardware acceleration on Edge is enabled. Bug report was sent to Microsoft including step by step instructions, command and
  video with diagnostic data.
